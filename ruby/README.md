# Week 1 - Ruby

## Day 1

### Introduction

- "Java was like having a rich lawyer as a brother. He was fun when he was younger,
  but now heâ€™s a black hole that sucks away all the joy in a 100-mile radius."

- Ruby taught me to smile again

- Mary Poppins analogy

### Decisions

- I like his talk about unless/if suffix forms, but I only partially agree.
  These are really only helpful to me if the condition is simple, e.g. single
  method call.
